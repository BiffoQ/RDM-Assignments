METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION

Description of methods used for collection/generation of data: 

X-ray diffraction
The X-ray diffraction patterns were collected on a Panalytical X'Pert Pro X-ray diffractometer with a Cu K-alpha source in a 2θ range of 10 to 100° in reflection geometry. 
Due to the moisture sensitivity of the samples, a custom-made airtight sample holder was used. 
The sample holder consisted of a zero-diffraction silicon wafer (SilTronix), closed off with a kapton half-cylinder. 
The instrument parameter file was created by measuring a LaB6 standard obtained from NIST [DOI: 10.1039/D2TA08433C].

Impedance measurement -- a close description of the material studied is adapted from Sacha et al. [DOI: 10.1038/s41563-020-0629-4]

Impedance spectroscopy measurements were recorded on a dense Ba7Nb4MoO20 pellet sample (roughly 10 mm diameter and 1 mm thickness) with a Solartron 1260 impedance analyser in the frequency range 0.1 Hz–1 MHz 
with an applied alternating voltage of 0.1V. Pt electrodes were painted on both sides of the pellet using a Pt-paste subsequently cured at 900°C.
Data were recorded on cooling from 800 °C in a sealed tube furnace under a flow of various gases, measuring roughly every 15°C and allowing 2h of equilibration at each temperature step.


Methods for processing the data: Data was processed with different softwares depending on the information needed.
